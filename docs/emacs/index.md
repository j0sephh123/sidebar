# Learning Emacs thanks to Discord
I got the idea from __The Programming Hangout__ discord server 
__what-is-emacs__ section

to start type `emacs` in `Ctrl + Alt + T`

"C-" --> The "CTRL" key
"M-" --> The "Meta" key (usually, the "Alt" key)
"s-" --> The "Super" key (the "Cmd" key on Macs and the "Windows" key on PCs

- buffer - a bunch of text that emacs is editing, can be text in memory, doesn't need to be a file.
- when it is a file - buffer is "visiting" that file
- frame - window
- cut and paste - killing and yanking
- point - position of the cursor
- major mode - for example when editing a python file

Navigation basics
- C-n next line
- C-p previous line
- C-f Go forward one character
- C-b Go backward one character
- M-f Go forward one word
- M-b Go backward one word
- M-a move to the beginning of the sentence
- M-e Move to the end of the sentence
- C-a --> Move to the beginning of the line
- C-e --> Move to the end of the line
- M-< ("Meta+Shift+,") --> Go to the beginning of the buffer 
- M-> ("Meta+Shift+.") --> Go to the end of the buffer 
- C-v scroll down by one screen full
- C-l move current line to the screen's center

- C-u 3 C-p  --> Go up 3 lines
- C-u 5 C-f  --> Go forward 5 characters

- C-x C-c --> Quit Emacs and get prompted to save any unsaved files
- C-x C-s --> Save the current buffer
- C-s search 

- Alt + m to access Spacemacs commands 

### From the Emacs menu - 
- ? - quickhelp

- qR - restart apparently
- in the menu ? - shows keybindings


### [Layers](https://www.spacemacs.org/layers/LAYERS.html)

- Alt + mft - open file explorer

### How to's
M-m ft opens NeoTree, Shift + K to go up in a dir
