## This is the place to express my hatred towards this (I am very unsure how to call it) 

Let's just call it a monster

### Level 1. Try to have a discussion about that.

So, let's begin, why the place where you write your wonderful code is called a theme exactly?
```php
<?php 
if ( have_posts() ) : 
    while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); 
        // oh my god..
    endwhile; 
endif; 
?>
```

### Level 2. Being very anxious of what you saw.

### Level 3. Starting to get scared. Who can be that evil to create such a form of torture?

### Level 4. Think of a way out. How do you escape ?

### Level 5. I can just close this. Bye.
