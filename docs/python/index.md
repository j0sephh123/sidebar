# hello to python

## Actually use the command prompt to interract with our future program !

### Reading input

When `input()` is called, the program flow stops until the user enters the input via the command line. By default converts to string. Minimal example:
```python
txt = input("Type something to test this out: ")
print("Is this what you just said? ", txt)
```

### Creating a small array manipulation script class
[Very Good Resources](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list/reverse)
Needed functionalities:

- create txt file
- delete txt file
- modify txt file
- get len
- create an empty array
- add a string or a number to the array
- delete string 
- delete index
- reverse the array
- move string from pos1 to pos2

- move string behind another one
- move string infront of another one
- move string at the start
- move string at the end

### Parsing number
`int(string)`

### Get variable type
`type(i)`

### Working with json
`json.dumps` === `JSON.stringify`
`json loads` === `JSON.parse`
