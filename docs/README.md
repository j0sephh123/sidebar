# Well, this is the start page..

### I'll try to help myself with cheatsheet how to use this Static Site Generator, but first let's write some ramblings.

### The Why
- _Why do you code exactly ?_ 
> A hobby is a regular activity done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time, not professionally and not for pay.  

Currently, I am also doing it professionally.

### We want apps, not words..
- _Why are you writing nonsense here instead of showing a cool looking portfolio with todo apps and calculators ?_  
Dunno, I have no interest in doing that anymore. I find it extremely boring.  
I prefer to mix things up, let's have some kind of docs and some kind of a portfolio here.  

- _But this isn't a documentation, nor a portflio, you are achieving nothing here._  
Please define what I'm trying to achieve first..

### What is a portfolio?
For me __portflio__ is completely meaningless, it only helps you find a job and what do you do with it after that?  

The main question here is ? Is it possible to find a job without a portfolio /s ?  

But still, I would like to continue on that and even have the audacity to say that I find Vuepress to be more "impressive / interesting" than googling for [this](https://www.canva.com/learn/portfolio/) and using premade stuff.  

- _But... you are doing the same with Vuepress.._  
Actually, that's correct... To some extend...

- _Ok, let's continue.. Let's hear yours arguments.._  
When someone is trying to __explain__ something, you can quickly grasp what is his level of __understanding__. (_Real nice, you gotta be a very smart one.. Where exactly did you copy that from?_)
How do you know that this person __made__ the portfolio things exactly?

### Thoughts
But __most importantly__, I have the opportunity to write this using standard markdown [syntax](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html#markdown-extensions) (plus some cool extras) on a premade beautifully looking templates. I can also extend the functionality with Vue components.  

The main point I'm trying to make here is that I value __scalability__ and __reusability__. This is just a consecutive example for that. I'm not able to create a typical portfolio. My body rebels against that..

::: details Possible benefints for creating this: 
  - gain knowledge on how to write documentation
  - how to use Vuepress 
  - a little bit of Vue
  - have fun
  - create something that can be extended
  - admire the effort of the people who created this
  - conversation starter

- _You claim that you code for fun and there's no way you haven't made a calculator or todo, or tic-tac-toe.._  
Probably, but currently I don't see a point in searching for these things.

- _Yes, but coding is about doing the basics. We need to see how you do basic stuff like that._  
You're probably in the wrong place, I'm not trying to show some cool coding skills or to impress anybody.

- _How does someone then assess your coding skills._    
Give me an exercise.. Something that you find interesting and would show me your solution also, not __fizzbuzz__, please. It's always fascinating to compare different solutions to the same problem.  

- _We need to see a fullstack application that is already deployed, working and has at least 1000 users._
Well, sorry to disappoint you.

- _Why are you using Vuepress, don't you claim to be a React developer ?_ 
Yes, but I like Vuepress more than Gatsby. I'm open to suggestions for a better library to do this in React and I will definitely try it.

- _Anyway, I want to see something after all ?_  
[This](https://github.com/j0sephh123/Shop) is from May 2018. The end __result__ is in its README. I guess, I didn't follow on the promises made back then.

- _What a piece of $@#%... And you claim to be a React developer ?_  
Well, I am.. I never said I'm a good one, though..

- _Is this all you got ?_  
`ctrl + f` How does someone then assess your coding skills
